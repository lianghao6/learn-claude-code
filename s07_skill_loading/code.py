s07: Skill Loading — two-level on-demand knowledge injection.

  Layer 1 (cheap, always present):
    SYSTEM prompt includes skill names + one-line descriptions (~100 tokens/skill)
    "Skills available: agent-builder, code-review, mcp-builder, pdf"

  Layer 2 (expensive, on demand):
    Agent calls load_skill("code-review") → full SKILL.md content
    injected via tool_result (~2000 tokens/skill)

  skills/
    agent-builder/SKILL.md
    code-review/SKILL.md
    mcp-builder/SKILL.md
    pdf/SKILL.md

Changes from s06:
  + build_system() — scan skills/ dir at startup, inject catalog into SYSTEM
  + load_skill(name) — return full SKILL.md content via tool_result
  + SKILLS_DIR config
  Loop unchanged: load_skill auto-dispatches via TOOL_HANDLERS.

Run: python s07_skill_loading/code.py
Needs: pip install anthropic

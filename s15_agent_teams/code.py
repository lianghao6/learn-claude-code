s15: Agent Teams — MessageBus + spawn_teammate_thread + inbox injection.

Run:  python s15_agent_teams/code.py
Need: pip install anthropic + 

Changes from s14:
  - MessageBus class: file-based mailboxes (.mailboxes/*.jsonl)
  - spawn_teammate_thread: creates teammate in background thread
  - Teammate runs own simplified agent_loop (bash, read, write, send_message)
  - Lead tools: spawn_teammate, send_message, check_inbox (3 new)
  - Lead inbox: teammate messages injected into history (not just printed)
  - Teaching version: teammates limited to 10 rounds (real CC uses idle loop)

ASCII flow:
  Lead: cron_queue → messages → prompt → LLM → TOOLS ────→ loop
                ↑                     ↓                        |
                └── inbox ← MessageBus ← teammate.send_message ←┘
  Teammate: inbox → LLM → bash/read/write/send → loop (max 10 turns)
